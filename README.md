# IEL Project

## Introduction

This project involves solving a set of mathematical computations, documenting the step-by-step procedure, presenting results, and providing necessary files for evaluation. The documentation follows the specified format, including your name, login, and a clear summary table.

## Participant Information

- **Name:** Matej Tomko  
- **Date:** 19.12.2021

## Project Submission

The project is submitted in PDF format along with source files, all compressed in a ZIP file named according to the login (e.g., `xlogin00.zip`).

## General Approach

All calculations were performed in a generic form, and numerical values were substituted into the final formulas. Units were converted appropriately, especially when dealing with angles (e.g., radians to degrees).

## Evaluation Criteria

The project aims for a maximum of 12 points, considering correctness, the aesthetic quality of the documentation, and adherence to submission requirements.  

**Total Points:** 8.5/12
